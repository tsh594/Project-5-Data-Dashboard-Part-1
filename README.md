  - Each row shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions
- [x] **`useEffect` React hook and `async`/`await` are used**

  - Weather conditions (Clear, Clouds, Rain, Snow)

### Optional Features

- [x] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [x] Filters use different input types

## Technical Implementation

**Key Components:**
- Fetches data from OpenWeatherMap API (weather + forecasts)
- Uses Unsplash API for dynamic background images
- Implements Pexels as fallback image source
- React hooks for state management (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- Async/await for API calls
- Debounced search suggestions

**Filter Logic:**
```javascript
const filteredData = weatherData.filter(data => {
  const matchesSearch = data.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase());
  const matchesTemp = data.main.temp >= filters.tempRange[0] && 
                     data.main.temp <= filters.tempRange[1];
  const matchesWind = data.wind.speed >= filters.windSpeed;
  const matchesConditions = filters.conditions.length === 0 || 
                           filters.conditions.includes(data.weather[0].main);
  
  return matchesSearch && matchesTemp && matchesWind && matchesConditions;
});
